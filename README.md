# Hi, I'm humoridze 👋

I’m a backend developer from Russia with around **4 years of experience**, focused on building business automation tools — especially through **Telegram bots**, APIs, and integration-heavy solutions. I care deeply about **privacy, speed, and reliability** in everything I build.
